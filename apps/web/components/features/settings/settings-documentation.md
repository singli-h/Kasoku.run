# Settings Feature Technical Overview

## Architecture

The Settings feature is implemented as a self-contained module following the mini-project pattern. It provides comprehensive user account and preference management capabilities.

## Component Structure

### Main Components
- **SettingsLayout**: Main container providing navigation between settings sections
- **AccountSettings**: Profile information management
- **PreferencesSettings**: User preferences and notifications
- **SecuritySettings**: Password and authentication settings
- **IntegrationsSettings**: Third-party service connections

### Hooks
- `useSettings`: Main settings state management
- `usePreferences`: User preference management
- `useIntegrations`: Third-party integration management

### Types
- `SettingsState`: Overall settings state type
- `UserPreferences`: User preference definitions
- `Integration`: Third-party integration types

## Data Flow
1. Settings data is fetched from server actions
2. Local state is managed through feature-specific hooks
3. Updates are persisted through centralized actions in `/actions/settings`
4. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback

## Integration Points
- **Auth**: Uses Clerk for authentication state
- **Database**: Persists preferences in Supabase
- **Actions**: Server actions handle all data mutations
- **UI Components**: Leverages shared UI components from `/components/ui`

## Security Considerations
- All settings updates require authentication
- Sensitive operations (password change) require re-authentication
- API keys for integrations are stored securely
- User permissions are validated server-side
