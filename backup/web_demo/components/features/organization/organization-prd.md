## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React components using shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks
- **Server Actions**: Next.js server actions for data operations
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Organizations table (existing)
organizations: id, name, stripe_customer_id, subscription_status, created_at, updated_at

-- Users table (existing)
users: id, clerk_id, email, first_name, last_name, avatar_url, onboarding_completed

-- Memberships table (existing)
memberships: id, organization_id, user_id, created_at

-- User_roles table (existing)
user_roles: id, membership_id, role_id, assigned_at
```

### API Endpoints
- **Server Actions**: All operations through Next.js server actions
- **No REST APIs**: Using server actions pattern for type safety

## MVP Scope & Limitations

### Included in MVP
✅ **3-step wizard flow**  
✅ **Organization creation**  
✅ **Basic team planning (email validation only)**  
✅ **Role assignment (client_admin auto-assigned to creator)**  
✅ **Company name validation**  
✅ **Responsive design**  
✅ **Integration with existing auth/database**  

### Excluded from MVP (Future Enhancements)
❌ **Actual team invitations** (Clerk integration)  
❌ **Industry/team size data persistence** (only name stored)  
❌ **Organization editing** (post-creation management)  
❌ **Multi-organization support**  
❌ **Advanced team management**  
❌ **Analytics tracking**  
❌ **Custom invitation templates**  

## Risk Assessment

- **Mitigation**: Clear explanations and help text throughout wizard

- **Risk**: Wizard abandonment due to length
- **Mitigation**: Optional team step, minimal required information

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Feature not meeting user expectations
- **Mitigation**: MVP approach allows for quick iteration based on feedback
