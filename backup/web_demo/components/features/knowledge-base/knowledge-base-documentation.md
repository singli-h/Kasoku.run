# Knowledge Base Feature Documentation

## Technical Overview

The Knowledge Base feature provides a comprehensive knowledge management interface that leverages existing composed components for consistency and development efficiency. **As of January 3, 2025, the Knowledge Base now includes full comment system integration**, supporting collaborative discussions on articles using the same universal comment system as tasks.

### Composed Component Reuse

The Knowledge Base feature maximizes reuse of existing composed components:

- **ListContainer**: Main page wrapper for articles and integrations
- **ListHeader**: Page headers with actions
- **ListFilters**: Search, filtering, and sorting
- **ListItem**: Base for article and integration cards
- **ListEmptyState**: Empty states for new orgs
- **ListSkeleton**: Loading states
- **CommentSection**: Universal comment component shared with tasks ✨ NEW

### Route Structure

- `/knowledge-base` - Main page with articles and integrations
- `/knowledge-base/articles/[id]` - Article detail view **with comment discussions** ✨ NEW
- `/knowledge-base/articles/create` - Article creation

## Comment System Integration ✨ NEW

### Universal Comment Architecture

The Knowledge Base now leverages the **universal comment system** that supports multiple entity types:

#### Database Design
```sql
comments (
  id: integer,
  organization_id: integer,
  entity_type: 'kb_article',  -- Universal entity support
  entity_id: integer,         -- References kb_articles.id
  content: text,
  author_id: integer,
  parent_id: integer,         -- Hierarchical threading
  is_deleted: boolean,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
)
```

#### Key Features
- **Cross-entity compatibility**: Same comment system works for tasks and KB articles
- **Entity validation**: Comments validated against article existence and user access
- **Hierarchical threading**: Unlimited nested comment replies
- **Organization isolation**: Comments properly scoped to organization membership
- **Real-time updates**: Comment sections refresh immediately after actions

### Server Actions Integration

The Knowledge Base reuses comment server actions from the task system:

```typescript
// Imported from @/actions/knowledge-base (re-exported from tasks)
- createCommentAction(data): Create comment on article
- getCommentsAction('kb_article', articleId): Get article comments
- updateCommentAction(id, data): Update comment content
- deleteCommentAction(id): Delete comment
- replyToCommentAction(parentId, content): Reply to comment thread
```

### Type Safety & Data Transformation

Comments are properly transformed between database and UI formats:

```typescript
// Database comment format
interface CommentWithAuthor {
  id: number
  content: string
  author: User
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
  // ... other fields
}

// UI comment format (used by CommentSection)
interface Comment {
  id: string
  content: string
  author: {
    id: string
    name: string
    avatar?: string
    initials: string
  }
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

The comment system includes several database optimizations:

```sql
-- Entity-specific indexes for fast article comment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_entity ON comments(entity_type, entity_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_org_entity ON comments(organization_id, entity_type, entity_id);

-- Thread loading optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_parent ON comments(parent_id) WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_created_at ON comments(created_at DESC) WHERE is_deleted = false;
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Scope ✅ COMPLETED
1. Main knowledge base page with dual sections
2. Article listing with search/filter using composed components
3. Integration grid with connection status
4. Basic article creation form
5. Article detail view **with comment discussions** ✨ NEW
6. **Universal comment system integration** ✨ NEW

### Component Dependencies
- Existing composed components from `@/components/composed`
- UI components from `@/components/ui`
- Server actions for data management (including comment actions)
- Type definitions for articles, integrations, and comments
- **CommentSection component** ✨ NEW

### Data Flow
1. Server components fetch KB articles and integrations
2. **Comment data loaded alongside article details** ✨ NEW
3. Composed components handle display, filtering, and interaction
4. **CommentSection manages comment threads and user interactions** ✨ NEW
5. Client components manage local state and user interactions
6. Server actions handle CRUD operations for articles and comments

## Security & Validation

### Entity Validation ✨ NEW

Comments include robust validation to ensure data integrity:

```typescript
// Entity validation before comment creation
async function validateEntityAccess(
  supabase: any,
  entityType: 'kb_article',
  entityId: number,
  organizationId: number
): Promise<void> {
  // Verify article exists and user has access
  const { data: article } = await supabase
    .from('kb_articles')
    .select('id, organization_id, is_deleted')
    .eq('id', entityId)
    .eq('organization_id', organizationId)
    .eq('is_deleted', false)
    .single()

  if (!article) {
    throw new Error('Article not found or access denied')
  }
}
```

### Access Control
- **Organization isolation**: Users can only comment on articles in their organizations
- **Article visibility**: Comments inherit article access permissions
- **Author permissions**: Users can edit/delete their own comments
- **Entity integrity**: Comments validated against existing, accessible articles

## User Experience

### Comment Integration
- **Seamless experience**: Comments naturally integrated into article detail view
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate UI updates after comment actions
- **Thread navigation**: Intuitive comment threading and reply system
- **Author attribution**: Clear comment authorship with user profiles
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during comment submission

### Collaboration Features
- **Knowledge discussions**: Team members can discuss and clarify article content
- **Content improvement**: Comments can drive article updates and revisions
- **Knowledge sharing**: Comments visible to all organization members
- **Contextual conversations**: Discussions tied directly to specific articles
