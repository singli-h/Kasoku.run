# Authentication Setup Summary

## Initial Issue
- SSO (Single Sign-On) callback endpoint resulted in 404 after Google account sign-up
- No user was being created in Clerk
- Initial redirect URL was configured only for mobile SSO in Clerk settings

## Changes Made

### 1. Clerk Dashboard Configuration
- Updated Component Paths:
  ```
  <SignIn />: /login
  <SignUp />: /register
  <UserButton />: / (after sign out)
  ```
- Application Homepage: /planner

### 2. Environment Variables (.env.local)
Current configuration:
```env
# Clerk URLs Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/login
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/register
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/session
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/session
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SSO_CALLBACK_URL=/auth/sso-callback
```

### 3. Code Structure Changes
- Created new SSO callback handler at `/auth/sso-callback`
- Removed legacy NextAuth.js configuration
- Updated middleware to include new SSO callback path
- Simplified `/auth/callback` route for backward compatibility

### 4. Google OAuth Configuration
- Maintained Google OAuth redirect URI as: `https://modern-bunny-27.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/oauth_callback`
- This is Clerk's internal endpoint for processing OAuth responses

### 5. Authentication Flow
1. User initiates Google sign-in
2. Google authenticates and sends response to Clerk's OAuth callback
3. Clerk processes authentication and creates/updates user
4. Clerk redirects to application's SSO callback (`/auth/sso-callback`)
5. Application handles session creation and redirects to appropriate page

## Current Status
- Migrated from NextAuth.js to Clerk
- Cleaned up authentication routes and configuration
- Implemented proper SSO callback handling
- Maintained backward compatibility where needed

## Environment
- Development environment with custom credentials enabled
- Using Clerk's test environment (indicated by test keys)
- Supabase integration maintained for database operations

## Notes for Future Development
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BYPASS_AUTH=true` is set for development
- Webhook secret is configured for Clerk-Supabase synchronization
- Frontend API endpoint is set to Clerk's development instance
